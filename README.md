# GRAPE_BosonicQubits

Repository for simulating Hubbard model with multiple oscillator-qubit systems using GRAPE algorithm.

## Installation

Fork the repo, and follow the instructions [here](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html) to install qutip devloper version from the qutip folder.

## Project Structure

Most of the codes are given in this repo, where **dynamics.py** is the main file to run. **config.json** stores the parameters of the physical system and GRAPE algorithm. **optimizedPulse** stores information of two sample optimized pulse amplitudes.
